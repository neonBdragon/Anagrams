# Anagrams
You are given a list of N words (strings containing only lower case letters of the English alphabet). We consider two words to be equivalent if they contain the same letters, i.e. we can rearrange the letters of one word in order to obtain the other word.  Compute the size of the largest subset of equivalent words.
